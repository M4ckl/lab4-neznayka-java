# lab4-neznayka-java

According to the given variant, based on the provided text excerpt from a literary work, create an object model of the real or imaginary world described in the text. The main characters and objects with their associated states and behaviors should be highlighted. Based on the model, write a program in Java.

<strong>Task Stages:</strong>

- Obtain the variant.

- Create a UML diagram representing the classes, interfaces, and their relationships.

- Design a scenario with character actions similar to those in the text.

- Agree on the diagram and scenario with the instructor.

- Write a Java program implementing the object model and scenario, reflecting changes in object states and displaying output similar to the original text.

- Demonstrate the program on the Helios server.

- Answer control questions and complete additional tasks.

Note: The output does not need to exactly replicate the original text or include grammatical correctness.

<strong>Requirements for the Object Model, Scenario, and Program:</strong>

1. <strong>Represent the main characters and objects</strong> with necessary attributes and behaviors, forming a proper inheritance hierarchy.

2. <strong>Implement OOP principles:</strong> encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Follow SOLID principles and ensure extensibility.

3. <strong>Make the scenario variable</strong> with random elements and changing actions based on the initial state of characters, objects, or environment.

4. <strong>The object model must include at least</strong>:

  - Abstract class with one abstract method.

  - Interface.

  - Enumeration (enum).

  - Record.

  - Array or ArrayList for homogeneous objects.

  - Checked exception.

5. <strong>Correctly override equals(), hashCode(), and toString() in the main character and object classes. Override getMessage() in exception classes.

6. Handle created <strong>checked and unchecked exceptions</strong>.

7. You may add <strong>internal, local, and anonymous classes</strong> if needed.
